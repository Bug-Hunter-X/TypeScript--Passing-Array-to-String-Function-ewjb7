# TypeScript Bug: Passing Array to String Function

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: passing an array to a function that expects a string argument.  The `greeter` function is designed to take a string and return a greeting. However, passing an array results in a compilation error.

The solution involves type checking and potentially adjusting the function signature to handle arrays or other data types appropriately.
